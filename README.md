# Note-Art JS

> Musical Project By Sean Dvir

### A Work in progress!
Music is a highly versatile art that originates in nature, and has been taken up by mankind as a way of expression and also as an art.
Now, it's going to be taken up by machines as well.
-
This project aims to create a library that implements all of music theory(in all it's forms) in code, then create AI that will use that theory, math, and neuroscience to compose music in different styles and genres.
It will also be used to create multiple tools for people to practice, learn, enjoy and compose.

## Installation

``` bash
# go to project folder
npm install note-art
```
